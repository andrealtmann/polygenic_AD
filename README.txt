These are R-scripts to run association studies in ADNI between
polygenic scores and various Alzheimer's related traits.

The scripts assume that following packages are installed:
ADNIMERGE (available from ADNI)
data.table
survival
lme4

Run following scripts
diagnosis.R 		-> test association to clinical diagnosis
csf_biomarker.R 	-> test association with CSF biomarker
pet_amyloid-av45.R 	-> test association with regional amyloid burden  

cog_decline.R		-> test association with longitudinal cognitive decline
clinical_conversion.R	-> test association with clinical conversion (survival analysis)

Enjoy!
